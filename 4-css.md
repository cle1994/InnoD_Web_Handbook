## Introduction

CSS, cascading style sheets, is a language used to describe the presentation
for markup languages. It's most commonly used to style web pages.

While I would love to sit here and list all the possible properties you can use
it's conveniently available
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) with examples
thanks to Mozilla.

properties.
