## Introduction

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to
create web pages. If you want to do web dev, you're going to write HTML.

## Elements

An **element** is a part of webpage. They define the semantic meaning of their
content. Elements include two matching tags and everything in between. It
contains at least one tag (we'll go more in depth later about tags). Elements
can contain images, text, other elements, or even nothing.

```html
<div class="outer-element">
  <p class="inner-element"></div>
  <p class="another-inner-element"></div>
</div>
```

Here we see an outer element with two paragraphs as inner elements.
