# The Handbook for Innovative Design's Web Tier
By [Christian Le](https://github.com/cle1994)

# Preface
**This is by no means the definitive guide to all things web or web development.**

I wrote this as a guide to aid in your growth as a web developer, whether your focus is in development or in design. I also wanted a basis for all web tiers going forward to have. Take this book, learn, teach, grow, and then make pull requests for all the dumb things I write or all the mistakes I make. But let's face it I don't make mistakes - just kidding, maybe.

The information found in this book comes from my failures, errors, and growth as an intern and a technical co-founder. Again, this isn't a definitive guide to anything, just an aid, take it how you will.

# Acknowledgements
