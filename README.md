# Preface
**This is by no means the definitive guide to all things web or web development.**

Whether you're in Web Exploration or Web Development, it doesn't matter, you're here to both learn and teach. You'll learn from your tier leaders and they from you, it's two way relationship. And as cliche as this sounds, you get what you put in. If you want to learn a lot, put yourself out there.

<!-- Should put in a brief about you, you kind of did it below but make it more formal intro, because people are going to be like who is this guy semesters later. Talk about: your role in InnoD web, like web tier leader, web advisor, web exploration founder, and talk briefly about some of your industry experience so you sound trustworthy -->

I wrote this as a guide to aid in your growth as a web developer, whether your focus is in development or in design. I also wanted a basis for all web tiers going forward to have. Take this book, learn, teach, grow, and then make pull requests for all the dumb things I write or all the mistakes I make. But let's face it I don't make mistakes - just kidding, maybe.

The information found in this book comes from my failures, errors, and growth as an intern and a technical co-founder. Again, this isn't a definitive guide to anything, just an aid, take it how you will.

Also, I use a Mac, so instructions will be assuming you use a Mac, sorry :disappointed:. I'll try to add as much Windows and Linux as a can but no guarantees it'll work. (Please pull request me for added instructions for those operation systems).
