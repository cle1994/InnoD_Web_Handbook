# What Is Web Tier?

Whether you're in Web Exploration and Web Development, it doesn't matter, you're
here to learn and teach. You'll learn as much from your tier leaders as your
teach them, it's two way relationship. And as cliche as this sounds, you get
what you put in. If you want to learn a lot, put yourself out there.

I guess I never answered, what is web tier, it's a safe place for you to mess up
and fail a lot. Take it from a veteran, I've failed 90% of the time and
succeeded the other 10%. But you learn so much more from failing. Don't be
afraid to break everything (that's why we have branches in GitHub :grin:). Most
importantly, ask your damn questions, no one is judging you, you're all here to
learn. Your tier leaders won't magically know all the problems you might have.

*If someone does call you out for asking a "dumb question" just tell me, I can
make them feel really dumb*

Lastly, you're a part of the club/organization
[Innovative Design](http://innovativedesign.club). Go to the socials and meet
people. It's good for you.

With that...

### Learn something new about your tier members
No seriously, I'm a strong supporter of pair programming and team dynamic.
You're going to be learning a lot from each other so get to know everyone; it
makes things a lot more fun.

*Tier Leaders, make them socialize :smiley:*
