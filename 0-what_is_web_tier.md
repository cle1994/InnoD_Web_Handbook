# What Is Web Tier?

Web tier is a safe place for you to mess up and fail a lot. Take it from a
veteran, I've failed 90% of the time and succeeded the other 10%. But you learn
so much more from failing. Don't be afraid to break everything (that's why we
have branches in GitHub :grin:). Most importantly, ask your damn questions, no
one is judging you, you're all here to learn. Your tier leaders won't magically
know all the problems you might have, so speak up!

*If someone does call you out for asking a "dumb question" just tell me, I can
make them feel really dumb*

Lastly, you're a part of the club/organization
[Innovative Design](http://innovativedesign.club). Go to the socials and meet
people. It's good for you.

With that...

### Learn something new about your fellow tier members
I'm a strong supporter of pair programming and team dynamic. You're going to be
learning a lot from each other so get to know everyone; it will make things a
lot more fun.

*Tier Leaders, make them socialize :smiley:*
