# Setup and Basics

## [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

**ONLY IF YOU'RE ON MAC**

In Terminal:

```bash
> ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

## [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

**LEARN GIT, IT'S IMPORTANT**

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. What does that mean? Pretty much it lets you make edits to your code/files and put them under versions so you can revert them if something goes bad.

I or your tier leader could teach you Git but honestly, this is more fun: [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). More advance functions like pull requests and merge conflicts well be taught by your tier leader. 

*If you're hardcore, here's the [documentation for Git](https://git-scm.com/documentation)*

#### [Github](https://github.com)

I recommend using GitHub for your remote version control. If you're a student you get 5 private repositories for free, plus bunch of other goodies [here](https://education.github.com/).

#### Installation

**Mac**

In Terminal:

```bash
> brew install git
```

**Windows**

Follow instructions found [here](http://msysgit.github.io)

**Linux**

In Terminal:

*Fedora*

```bash
> yum install git
```

*Debian/Ubuntu*

```bash
> apt-get install git
```

## [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

> Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

I can talk about node all day but for the purposes of Web Tier, it's used mostly for automation. If you're in Web Development, you might use it as a server framework.
