# Setup and Basics

## [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

**LEARN GIT, IT'S IMPORTANT**

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. What does that mean? Pretty much it lets you make edits to your code/files and put them under versions so you can revert them if something goes bad.

I or your tier leader could teach you Git but honestly, this is more fun: [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). More advance functions like pull requests and merge conflicts well be taught by your tier leader. 

*If you're hardcore, here's the [documentation for Git](https://git-scm.com/documentation)*

#### [Github](https://github.com)

I recommend using GitHub for your remote version control. If you're a student you get 5 private repositories for free, plus bunch of other goodies [here](https://education.github.com/).
